## Description

This was a class project for **ENGRC 3025 at Cornell University** where I worked throughout the semester to develop a personal website and online portfolio.
It is a static website that showcases my work experience, projects, and skills beyond what other mediums like LinkedIn or a Resume could portray.
I intended to go more in depth with my descriptions rather than simply reiterating the bullet points which recruiters probably would've already seen.

The website is done entirely in HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. Bootstrap was used for the navigation bar rather than building from scratch but a lot of modifications
to the styling were done to fit my layout better. The data for the projects and work experiences are located in JS files which are then imported into functions which
turn them into cards or timeline elements, respectively. Automating this process was a great way to ensure that the data was consistent and easy to update in the future.
The about page contains a short summary of my background and interests, as well as a photo of me. Technologies that I've used scroll across the screen and hovering
over them shows the name of the technology. The projects page has cards which contain a description of the project, an image carousel, relevant technologies, a link to
the GitHub Repo, and a link to an external website if it exists. The work experience page has a timeline with all of my previous experiences. Clicking on each bullet on
the timeline makes a card appear with the company name, role, duration of work, a description of what I did, and the technologies used. These pages can all be reached
through the navbar, which also contains a link to my Resume in PDF form. Lastly, social media icons for my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn are in the top right corner of every
page for easy access.

This project was my first experience using SCSS which I found to be much easier to work with than CSS. I enjoyed the use of variables and also nesting selectors to make
the code more readable and simpler to revisit. I worked on making the website responsive to different screen sizes which I had no experience with prior, and I found it to be challenging
but rewarding. It is important to be able to view websites on mobile devices especially in today's world, but I often overlook it on other projects because it is not a requirement.
For this website, my focus was more so on making it visually appealing instead of adding impressive functionalities, and I spent a lot of time tweaking various
elements to get them to look the way I wanted. I traditionally enjoy adding as many functionalities as possible and put aesthetics on the back burner, but I decided
this project would be a good opportunity to work on my design skills. I'm very proud of the way it turned out and I think it is very clean, informative, and easy to navigate.
I used GitHub pages to host on a custom domain which was purchased from cloudflare, so that I could have a nice looking URL that is easy to remember. Overall, I think it is
a successful portrayal of my professional identity, and it turned out much better than templates I had used in the past.
