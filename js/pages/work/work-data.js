      "description": "I worked as a software developer for the minibot CS team during my time on Cornell Cup Robotics. We consulted a large robotics company to create software for a cost-effective 3D printed robot that would be used in introductory programming and robotics courses. I worked on building a web application with a Javascript React frontend and Python Flask backend. The website connects to the onboard microcontroller using web sockets, allowing for controlling movement, writing scripts in Blockly and Python, and graphing the location relative to other tagged objects/robots. I also developed embedded software for the robot to connect to the server and respond accordingly using MicroPython, a lightweight subset of Python. The minibot team contained 30+ members across 4 different subteams including CS, ECE, Mechanical, and Business. We communicated with weekly scrum meetings and had many progress presentations throughout the semester to illustrate what we’d accomplished. It was a very rewarding experience and one of my first introductions to designing software in a large team environment with more structure than a personal or class project. It reinforced my understanding of version control, writing good documentation, programming embedded software, communicating through web sockets, and collaborating with a large team.I worked as a software developer for the minibot CS team during my time on Cornell Cup Robotics.

      "description": "I worked as a backend software engineer for the app development team during my tenure as an intern. I helped design a C# API using the .NET framework to organize data on the CLO market into JSON tables. The tables could be grouped by Gics Sector, CLO Manager,  and CLO. Each contained relevant financial data on CLOs such as AUM, Revenue Growth, and Net Leverage. I wrote integration tests using the NUnit testing frameworks, dealt with caching filtered table values using Redis, and contributed to the services and repositories behind the many different endpoints. It was a great experience working with a large team across many different domains such as product, frontend, and data and seeing how complex software is built in a professional setting. At the end of my internship, the website was launched publicly to clients and is currently used by tens of thousands of financial institutions globally. It was an extremely rewarding experience and I learned about picking up new technologies quickly, writing clean and maintainable code, cross-team collaboration, advanced version control, agile software development, and much more.\n",
